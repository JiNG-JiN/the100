<strong>Senn</strong><br><strong>Scotland, United Kingdom</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born in the highlands of Scotland, and bread on the Canadian prairie. My life changed midway through an undergraduate degree in literature when I read Nietzsche’s phrase, “I would only believe in a God who could dance.” My whole sense of self distilled around my passion for dance, movement exploration, and, eventually, aerial circus arts. A fortuitous move to Montreal to pursue a degree in dance led me to this hotbed of circus culture, which has nurtured me for the last decade of my professional life.  </p>
                    <p>The challenges I have faced along the way – I think immediately of injuries sustained and recovered from, but ultimately the failure of my relationship with my partner. Over the years I have always attempted to explore the meeting point between dance and circus. I am interested in participating in the project ONE, because it is an ideal playground for this exploration.
                    </p>

<strong>Juliet</strong><br><strong>New York, New York</strong>
</div>
                    <p>My family was very fortunate to have the finances to support my siblings and my many extra curricular activities, but after my mother became very sick and lost her job and my parents battled through their marital problems we were not so fortuitous with wealth. Dance had always been such a magnificent outlet for me as a child, and as a teenager I understood that I had a divine passion to perform and connect with others. </p>
                    <p>These passions lead me to find dance again in high school. This experience paved a limitless road of opportunity. Without the communities that I was brought up in, I would have never continued to pursue and my lifelong journey of dance. ONE creates the understanding that community is universal, that being one of a whole is just as important as being individual, and that each and everyone of us is affected by a movement.</p>

<strong>Sara</strong><br><strong>New York, New York</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born and raised on the New England coast by parents who were a chemist and a mechanical engineer.  At a young age, I was deeply involved in the arts, but never thought of it as a career option.  Despite entering college pre-med, I eventually listened to my inner artist resonating “I’m only young once”- graduated and moved to NYC to perform on a whim.  </p>
                    <p>My passion for aerial work began when my college dance professor wanted to fill the space above the dancers.  I had done gymnastics so I took to the different apparatus very quickly and was hooked!  Years later I am still performing in NYC and meeting fantastically interesting people through different shows and artistic endeavors.  I am excited to meet 100 new artists and hear how they made their way to ONE in NYC.  This is a monumental collaboration and I believe people will remember it for many years to come.</p>

<strong>Alexandra</strong><br><strong>East Slovakia, The Slovak Republic</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born and raised in East Slovakia with my 2 sisters Miriam and Lucia. I started her rhythmic gymnastics sport career at the age of 8 and became a multiple all-around rhythmic gymnastics champion. Inspired by my father who was a former gymnast and a talented musician, my coaches and I discovered I had an innate passion for performing in front of an audience. In 1994, inspired by western artists such as Michael Jackson, and films like “Flashdance” and “Dirty Dancing”, I immigrated to the United States to pursue my dreams with the support of my father Alexander, who told me to “do it with your heart and keep the child in you “. </p>
                    <p>Along the way, I was blessed to collaborate with my early heroes and inspirations, Kenny Ortega (Director of Dirty Dancing) and Michael Jackson in the “This is it” project until his untimely passing. ONE is important for me because I would like to share with the world the beauty of the human body, the sense on unity/humanity though movement, and to help innovate through performance art.</p>

<strong>David</strong><br><strong>New York, New York</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born in Syracuse, NY and spent most of my childhood practicing martial arts and acrobatics. My training led to multiple world championships in martial arts and tricking, jobs working for the Boston Celtics, the power rangers, and currently, for Spider-Man on Broadway.</p>
                    <p>I flew for the first time at my first of many, many auditions for Spider-Man about two years ago. This sparked an incredible interest and I am so grateful that I was ultimately hired as a main flyer at Spider-Man. The wirework I do nightly is far different from what I experience at my ONE audition, and I am now very eager to expand my skill-set in the air. Being a part of ONE will give me a chance to become great at another style of flying.</p>

<strong>Heather</strong><br><strong>Richmond, Virginia</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I am the founder of Host of Sparrows Aerial Dance in Richmond, VA. After years of training in other states, I pioneered a grassroots movement to create the first aerial dance troupe in Virginia by hosting out-of town teachers for adult aerial classes and teacher training. From this program, the troupe was formed.</p>
                    <p>As a kinetic learner, finding dance later in life, her greatest joys are seeing adults dance for the first time, and presumed “at-risk” young people embracing their kinetic learning style. I am absolutely elated to be collaborating with so many kinetic artists at once, and to bring home new skills and experiences to share with a Host of Sparrows.</p>

                    <p>I am an emerging contemporary dance artist from Montreal. I first began to dance at Saint-Laurent College and continued my formation at University of Quebec in Montreal (UQAM), obtaining my Bachelors with honorable mention.</p>
                    <p>Following my formation, I got to dance as an interpreter for the company Manon fait de la danse, and also developed my own choreographic work at Tangente, a space for contemporary dance presentation and public development in Montreal. Outside of the dance world, I also enriched my career path by collaborating with circus and theatre artists, which brought me to perform in Mexico with the circus collective Las Güeras, where we were invited artists to the 15e Festival de Mayo, in Guadalajara.</p>

<strong>KD</strong><br><strong>New York, New York</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I grew up in the sun, in the ocean, and always dancing on the southern coast of North Carolina, USA.  In 2000, while training and performing in 1st generation Dunham Technique I was told that I was “supposed to be an aerialist, because I had strength like no other dancer, and that no one was dancing in the air, that I would be the one to bring this missing element…” </p>
                    <p>I stayed in love with my life grounded and elevated in Dunham Technique and Motherhood, rather than flying with my feet off the ground.  While expecting our first child I was told, “It’s nice to know you are human.”  My physical life shifted from disciplined to nurture; I began flying to nurture myself, to get back into my body (literally), to be greater to myself and others, and it is now a discipline that I nurture.  </p>
                    <p>Working on ONE is a part of this journey and example I set for my children.  I fully believe in life’s limitless possibilities and the common threads in humanity.  I believe that ONE will bring people together that know this or need to remember…</p>

<strong>Katherine</strong><br><strong>St. Johnsbury, Vermont</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I spent my childhood wandering through the barns, fields, hills, and streams of my family’s farm in the backwoods of New England. Watching the skies and seasons pass, I found myself witness to the web of relationships spun across the land, to the cycles of life and death, and to the curiosities of my own heart. Visual art served as an early window to express my dreams, which were so often about movement and connection. </p>
                    <p>My paintings and woodblock prints are intricate scenes of gardens, woods, oceans—all with aerialists interwoven and cascading across the canvas landscapes. When I moved to New York City and discovered pole and aerial dance, I felt like I had finally come home to myself. As I strive to be a source of resilience, kindness, love, and support for those around me, my soul finds its strength and purpose through flight. ONE is an unparalleled feeling of wondrous possibility and connection with others. ONE is a realization of the immense power of imagination, artistry, community, and collaboration.</p>

                    <p>At the age of 9, my family immigrated to the state of Montana from our home in Germany. I began dancing at the age of 25 at the University of Montana after having changed majors several times. Through the support of teachers, mentors and peers, I flourished as an artist, individual and human being.</p>
                    <p>While in school, Holly Rollins, an inspiring aerial performer, cast me in a lyra (hoop) piece where I began my training and found my love for aerial dance. In 2012 I moved to NYC to pursue my dancing. All of the experiences–good and bad–have made me a stronger person, helping shape me into the artist I am today. ONE presents the opportunity to go on an incredible journey with like-minded individuals and ultimately share this journey of exploration and discovery with the world.</p>

                    <p>I was born into an artistic household in North Central Washington State where I was lovingly encouraged to study a wide range of arts mediums from a young age. As an eager dancer, pianist, singer and songwriter, I grew up enamored, -nearly obsessed-, with artistic potential and versatility.</p>
                    <p>From West Coast to NYC, despite inevitable roadblocks of injuries and isolation innate with creative development, I have found myself continually rewarded to be surrounded by such multi-faceted, graciously collaborative artists from the Broadway musical stage to humble open-mic bars to here: the open airwaves of one of New York’s iconic parks. ONE resonates so deeply with me because it symbolizes the human artistic potential while embracing the desire for collaborative unity. It redefines “performance” and offers it as a quiet gift to society. I am dumbfounded by this unique opportunity to literally soar to new artistic heights.</p>

                    <p>Finding your place in the world and deciding how you will respond to life’s challenges is a daunting task.  Every one of us has to overcome our fears, discover our strengths, and find balance in what we do.  For me, the ONE is a metaphor for this very human process – finding what inspires us, working with our physical selves, each other, and our collective resources to build what we envision, gladly facing the unknown.</p>
                    <p>The past 10 years have been this type of journey for me, as I worked to transform my body and my life to pursue a second career in aerial arts.  What I once thought impossible has truly freed my mind and proven a rare blessing.  My participation in ONE is confirmation of its message – that there isn’t just “one” type of person who can soar; we all can.</p>

<strong>Chiara</strong><br><strong>Perth, Australian</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I grew up in Perth, Western Australia.  After 10 years of representing my state and country in competitive rhythmic gymnastics, my love of utilizing my body and performing took me to the other side of Australia at 18 to study and train at the National Institute of Circus Arts in Melbourne. </p>
                    <p>I fell in love with aerials, specializing in tissu (aerial fabric), aerial hoop, net and both solo and duo straps.  Since graduating my career has taken me all over the world to see amazing places such as Singapore, India, UK, Europe, the South Pacific Islands and of course all over Australia.  To be a part of a project like ONE, would be inspiring to work with such a vast number of artists from all over the world, in such an iconic location.  ONE looks like a beautiful, unique project that I’m incredibly proud to be a part of.</p>

<strong>Eliane</strong><br><strong>Montréal, Canada</strong>
</div>
                    <p>To be who I am, and do what I do now, I had to find my way around pre-fab patterns acting against my true path. The experience of freedom is not an easy quest, challenged by society, doubt, boredom, stress, and other modern limitations.<br>
                    As a kid, I was feeling like an alien; later, I met other shining rebels, got on the road with nothing, no money, just myself: travelled lots, took lots of risks, running eyes closed just following my heart. </p>
                    <p>Now in circus, I still challenge conventions, no matter the judgment of others, the complicated process of dealing in collective projects, the emotional adventure of sensing myself and the world, no matter cash insecurity, mistakes, black feelings, feeling of being lost and alone: real life is always worth the groove of all senses. Suspended in the air, some simple moments of being is a state of grace in itself.</p>

                    <p>I was born in Point Pleasant, New Jersey and began dancing as a toddler at the Spring Lake School of Dance. I attended Temple University as an honors modern dance performance major with a concentration in ballet. One thing I witnessed, but never got to try, was aerial work. </p>
                    <p>I can honestly say that the day of the audition, I quite nearly died when they first said we would be put in a harness and flown in the air. But then I realized, how on earth could I turn that chance down just because I was a little bit afraid that I’d never done it before and was about to try it out for the first time in an audition?The freedom and magnitude of possibilities that I found flying through the air that day was incredible and I am beyond excited for the chance to continue exploring with ONE!</p>

                    <p>As someone who was born in Houston and raised in Chicago, who has traveled to and performed in many different states and countries, and who has lived in cities ranging from Los Angeles to Fargo, I am so happy to be able to call New York City my home. I realized that my path as a performing artist was destined for the world of aerial arts as I sat in the gorgeous theatre in the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas, experiencing Cirque du Soleil’s “Love”.  The feelings that I experienced that night seem to be exactly what ONE endeavors to provide to its audience members  – pure amazement, awe, wonder, and joy.  </p>
                    <p>Since I didn’t find my passion for aerial arts until my mid-twenties, I have had to work very diligently and spend countless hours training to become the silk artist that I am today. I hope together we can all bring the world of aerial and non-traditional performance art and space to the public of New York!

                    <p>I would like to believe that I am a passionate performer bringing graceful, charismatic choreography infused with strength.

                    <p>From wide-eyed, frolicking circus-type performances to dark, somber routines to ethereal nymph-like acts, I am well-versed and elastic, currently maintaining versatile works as a aerialist and explosive energy as a Cossack rider.

<strong>Autumn</strong><br><strong>Saint Petersburg, Florida</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I move to celebrate the human body.  I dance to explore the shapes within my own body and express emotions as I encounter them.  My background is classical and contemporary dance, and I developed a passion for aerial and circus in searching for new and more ways to connect with my audience.  Live performance is an experience for both the viewer and the artist, and with circus I found a more complete experience.  Aerial acrobatics truly is a death defying experience and taking on that risk to create a singular memory or a breath taking moment in someone’s life is one of the greatest gifts I can offer.</p>
                    <p>ONE will be a unique and inspiring experience for me and I am looking forward to meeting many talented artists and athletes.

<strong>Stacey</strong><br><strong>Saint Louis, Missouri</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born in St. Louis, MO where for as long as I can remember I was exposed to and involved in dance and the arts. My desire to perform in the air has always been there. I recall visualizing pieces in the air, dreaming of creations. I just never knew how to get there. It was a slow progression but once I did make it in the air I kept on going. My biggest challenge I would say was not having the exposure to the circus world at an earlier stage in my life, nor the funds to send me anywhere else for training if I had found it. </p>
                    <p>When I saw the information about ONE in New York I knew I wanted to be a part of it. Aside from the concept of being an individual doing a common thing, there can be a beauty to uniformity, which brings out the individual. I also see it like cells in the human body, a living piece to a puzzle…each of us contributing to its breath—air, to its heart beat—rhythm.</p>

                    <p>I was born in Columbus, Georgia. My brother and I were adopted at a young age and raised together by our new family: a family that opened my eyes to music and the arts. My father was a passionate jazz fan, my mother, and an all around music lover. I sang in choirs throughout school, which eventually led to performing in musicals, and studying to act. That soon led to dancing, tumbling, and eventually aerial work! The challenges I’ve faced thus far are the same challenges any passionate artist faces, fighting for a chance to do what I love to impact the lives of the people around me. </p>
                    <p>Having traveled the world and lived alongside over 90 different cultures, ONE represents that unity and peaceful coexistence that I’ve experienced firsthand. Nothing’s more beautiful and unique than unity, and ONE captures just that. I am thrilled to be a part of ONE!</p>

<strong>Karel</strong><br><strong>Montréal, Canada</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I started ballet at a very young age and took dance lessons during all of my school years. At nineteen I moved to New York city and studied in modern dance at the Alvin Ailey school. At the end of my training I was offered a contract with BJM_Dance (Ballet Jazz of Montreal) where I danced for a few years. </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately I later injured my knees and had to eventually quit dancing. That was a very big deception for myself and I had to look for an alternative discipline. For the past few years I’ve been working on using my dance background into developing an aerial vocabulary and organic movements. ONE in New York, being a fusion of dance in its natural environment, represents where I want to be as an artist at the moment. The idea of dancing in the air is to me where dance finally takes place as an entire entity; it is then complete since it knows how to defy but yet also embrace gravity all at once.</p>

                    <p>Born in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada my life has revolved around my passion and desire for movement. My movement vocabulary began with artistic and rhythmic gymnastics, and has expanded to include dance and circus. Studying modern dance and ballet at York University (Toronto), and contemporary dance and choreography at Concordia University (Montreal), I have picked up breakdance and parkour along the way. </p>
                    <p>I also studied at the National Circus School (Montreal), with a particular focus in dance trapeze, contortion, and Chinese Pole. I dream to choreograph and perform with a company of my own that creates movement and discussion inspired by dance, acrobatics, and artistic insight, challenging performance space and performance itself. ONE matches so many elements of my artistic and performativity values and interests, that being a part of this project is a gift both nurturing and inspiring to my personal aspirations.

                    <p>I grew up in the Washington DC area, South Arlington to be exact and grew up some more in Richmond VA. As a child, I explored everyday life for joy, something I refuse to grow out of. My perpetual search for joy led me to dance, to performing- it pulled me into the air and I haven’t come down since. My challenge with aerial is the loneliness.  I move with my apparatus but not with people. I believe moving in a group and dancing with others creates something sacred and impactful.  </p>
                    <p>This project is a rare chance to experience the sky as birds’ do- waving, soaring, and floating as one flock. Following my heart has led me to this project. Everyday I get to wake up excited because I know people will be looking up to the sky as we all share the story of ONE. And I’m a part of that.

                    <p>My love and experience as a performer has grown exceptionally over the years and I’m more than thrilled to be selected as a performer for ONE.  I can’t wait to be a part of this amazing production!</p>

                    <p>I was one of the first students at the circus school of Quebec in 1992. In 1998, I was chosen by Cirque Eos for the creation of the show Imaginaire. I’ve participated in various corporate event, and has over the 14 years, performed over 2000 times in several countries: USA, Canada, Mexico, Spain, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, UAE and Japan. My greatest talent is as a contortionist and was recognized at the Startissimo Festival of 2009.</p>

<strong>Nadia</strong><br><strong>Montréal, Canada</strong>
</div>
                    <p>My name is Nadia and I was born in a small city outside of Quebec City. I first fell in love with dance as a child when my dad brought me to see The Nutcracker, that even though I came to dance later in life and even though I ended up working as a psychological counselor.  About 4 and half years ago I discovered pole and I just felt at home with that discipline. </p>
                    <p>I started doing competitions, teaching and performing. Two 2 years ago, interested in the mechanics of movement and healing of injuries I began studying osteopathy. When the opportunity arose I decided to embark on the journey of ONE. Being a part of this event feels like realizing a dream, like a last chance to experience something bigger and amazing, to be part of a community of artists, share my passion, and contribute to the world of creation.

I worked very hard, trained at the top schools, and made it into a professional company where I extensively toured internationally for over a decade.  But now I am setting my dreams higher and I am looking for new experiences to challenge me.  </p>
                    <p>I recently moved to New York from Connecticut and am finding out that it is very hard to survive here.  But when I found ONE I knew I had found my next adventure.

<strong>Alissa</strong><br><strong>Hinsdale, Illinois</strong>
</div>
                    <p>My childhood near Chicago was spent throwing myself out of my playpen, climbing any tree I could find, dancing, flipping, and walking on my hands.  For my BFA thesis I painted expansive oil paintings of the constructed and deconstructed landscape.  Exploring the constant flux of our shared landscape and our place in these repeated cycles of digging, building, tearing down, and reemerging.  I felt constrained by traditional art materials and exhibition space and had an instinctive urge toward movement.  I was first interested in circus arts because of the relationships I made through music and acrobatics that transcended the barriers of language while backpacking in South America.  </p>
                    <p>When I committed to developing as an acrobat and aerialist; I met fear, vulnerability, and empowerment.  I spent four months performing aerial harness at the Worlds Expo in South Korea learning a new language of collaboration.  One day I was hiking and stumbled upon a Buddhist temple.  I was welcomed, fed, and offered a room to sleep and the next day I spotted the monks in the audience while flying over them.  To me the essence of ONE was captured in that moment and I hope to be part of the unlimited potential of this collaboration.</p>

                    <p>For the past 20 years, I’ve been training in tap, ballet, jazz and gymnastics.  After graduating from The Ohio State University with a degree in Nutrition I moved NYC to pursue my dancing career! Before I knew it, I fell into pole dancing when a friend of mine asked me to take an intro pole class.  It was love at first site! </p>
                    <p>Since then, I have grown as a dancer and has competed in competitions, performed in many shows and been a principle aerialist dancer in New York City’s aerial dance Company AERA. Currently, I love to teach pole and gymnastics at Body and Pole in NYC. I absolutely love the freedom and endless possibilities with being an aerialist as well as the confident and strength I have gained along the way! </p>

<strong>Alisan</strong><br><strong>Roxbury, New Hampshire</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I began dancing when I began walking. Amazing and influential teachers kindled my passion for choreography; but I began to seek more vertical dimensions of expression. And then: a gift.  Watching French circus, I rediscovered a reason to perform, to create and new ways to communicate with an audience. We drew the audience in, dancing in air; we were able to capture their emotions, to re-inspire their awe. </p>
                    <p>I began with Fly-By-Night, the San Francisco Circus Center, and then to Quebec City and Montreal where I diversified my techniques, my experiences, and deepened my love of aerials. I realized I am at home spinning in the air, following the forms, using the joy of centrifugal force to send my heart through space. From the moment I heard about this project, I have wanted to be involved with the scale, the interconnectedness, the individuality and the joyful spinning.

<strong>Sarah</strong><br><strong>Palo Alto, California</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born in Palo Alto, California, and spent the better part of my life living in Northern California. I grew up performing in local dance and theater productions, and in high school I discovered aerial arts. I moved to Portland, OR when I graduated to pursue a higher level of training with Pendulum Aerial Arts, and to attend Portland State University for a Bachelor’s degree in Theater Arts. </p>
                    <p>There were two main challenges in my work towards becoming a full-time aerial artist: making time to complete the Pendulum apprentice program, and two years in their professional company while also finishing college with high honors, and more recently: learning to be a self-employed artist. I was drawn to work on ONE because of the humanity of the project – because it is such a large-scale collaborative, to show what people can do when they work together.</p>

                    <p>Texan born, my mother encouraged me from the beginning to follow my heart. This led me immediately to the stage at 6 years of age.  Nine years later I began to dance professionally, touring across the country traveling to 48 states, Europe, Japan and eventually to New York. Here I was able to finally able to actively train in the aerial arts that I discovered so many years ago at performance of ‘Quidam’.  </p>
                    <p>Being a part of a project like ONE would be an experience like no other. It would allow me to fulfill a dream of being able to fly. Being in the third dimension feels completely natural and does not scare me. The hardest part of training thus far has been learning how to maintain a sense of fluidity and effortlessness whilst being airborne. Acting independently apart of this greater collection hundreds of feet off the ground is so magically symbolic of our global community and I hope inspires the individual to recognize his own interconnected nature with those around him.</p>

<strong>Madeline</strong><br><strong>Worcester, Massachussets</strong>

                    <p>I didn’t see this coming. When I started flying seven years ago here in NYC I had no foresight that this work would become my passion, my full-fledged career, and a constant source of artistic joy. I moved to New York after a year of touring, and the first phone call I made to my mom was to tell her I had an apprenticeship with a circus company. </p>
                    <p>It has been years of fighting between things I love and searching for my path as an artist. Recently, I decided to commit to all aerial all the time (with a healthy peppering of dance classes and performances to keep that corner off my heart happy). It was the right choice. I’m happiest when in flight seeking the mechanical solutions to working with the human body in a truly three-dimensional space. Who knew a girl from Worcester, MA would be flying in the Big Apple? Being part of ONE would be an affirming moment. This is who I am. This is the community I love. This is the art I want to be making. </p>

<strong>Caitlin</strong><br><strong>Seoul, South Korea</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I didn’t spend any time in the air until four years ago.  I was past 30, had already stopped dreaming about a career in the arts, and was settling for a “reasonable” job.  I had almost forgotten how valuable art and expression are to the human experience.  I would never have believed my first timid spin in a casual pole fitness class would lead to a career as an aerial pole performer and teacher. </p>
                    <p>When I auditioned for ONE, people asked if I’d be scared to dance 150 feet in the air, and I told them I was scared I wouldn’t get the chance to.  This opportunity means I am fortunate enough to finally be living – flying – beyond my wildest dreams.  I dedicate this journey to my late parents, who probably would not have understood my aerial pole dancing, but who would have been proud to see this adventure.</p>

In NYC, I pursued aerial training, which renders my utmost respect, fear, determination, and need to explore. </p>

                    <p>I began performing in Grade ONE as ‘Happy’ in Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. I became ONE of the founding members of Ballet Ouest de Montreal in my late teens, rising quickly from demi- to full soloist. I thought I could only have ONE career, so I quit dancing in my fourth year of pharmacy school to become a pharmacist.  I stumbled upon a flying trapeze class, but they wouldn’t let me take just ONE, so I had to sign up for a session – fun! </p>
                    <p>After graduating from the School of Toronto Dance Theatre (as ONE co-recipient of the Leadership Award) I met THE ONE, a New Yorker visiting Toronto.  Six years ago, I got my O-ONE visa and moved to New York to be with her. I was the ONE chosen to coach and add new aerial choreography to Monkey: Journey to the West at Lincoln Center this past summer. Now, I run Heliummm Aerial Dance  &amp; Entertainment, aerial lessons and performance. </p>

<strong>Aimee</strong><br><strong>Salem, Massachusetts</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born and raised in the Salem, Massachusetts.  At 6 I began studying violin and competing in gymnastics, unknowingly preparing myself to be in the air. The awareness, strength and physical intelligence I honed in the gym and the musicality, rhythm and understanding of group dynamics I soaked up in the orchestras have enabled me to travel with globe with world-renowned circus companies. </p>
                    <p>My body loves to fly, swing, spin, flip, twirl and dive. It was all…. challenging, physically and mentally intense – and at times painful and nauseating -passionate work!! Live movement performance is so special; it’s an important way for people to connect, for the artists and the audience alike. ONE is such a massive vision, people and experiences gathered from all over will come together to make a living sculpture 10 stories overhead. At last, the sky is not the limit but it is our stage!!

<strong>Satomi</strong><br><strong>Yamaguchi, Japan</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was raised in Yamaguchi, Japan where I started ballet training.  I came to the US to continue my dance education and graduated from Utah Valley University with a BFA in dance.  Right after I moved to the city, I found about ONE in New York.  As soon as I saw the website, statements, and videos, my mind was caught to ONE.  </p>
                    <p>ONE is such a new performing art form to me, and I was just impressed by the thoughts behind it as well as the performing.  I am thrilled to be a part of the performance because it would open a new window as a performer.  This is going to be a big challenge for me, but I am grateful for this special opportunity, and I cannot wait to share the experience with amazing people in NYC.</p>

<strong>Djassi</strong><br><strong>New York, New York</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born swiftly and gained the nickname Black Butterfly. I have been in flight ever since. Soaring between experiences, across countries and languages through the gift of dance. On break from boarding school in New England, I would audition at schools around the city and go wherever I received a scholarship. My first company experience was in Brazil, where I was the only American. Later, I joined Momix, which was the most informative and challenging professional experience: traveling the world as an Anthropologist, connecting with people through my art. </p>
                    <p>My first aerial experiences were in several Momix ballets. I would use those skills again years later for collaborations while living in Italy. ONE allows me to once again experience art and movement in its highest form: a collective of individual sparks coming together to light the night sky, touching performers and spectators alike in a radical visual collective.</p>

<strong>Trevor</strong><br><strong>New York, New York</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born and first raised only one block south of Central Park in New York City.  To the surprise of many, as a kid I struggled most with the following things: heights, comfort with strangers, physical exercise, and self-consciousness.  </p>
                    <p>After being inspired by the artists of Cirque du Soleil, I grew attached to aerial arts, for I found that it granted me strength in all of the ways I saw myself as weak. The practice granted self-trust, comfort, and challenge to my inhibitions.<br>
                    For these reasons, I attribute so much of my current self to this movement-based expression.  It grants me freedom, mental capacity, physical awareness, and salvaged a lot in me.  It is now the only way to be.  Performing in ONE serves personal reaffirmation that we cannot master life without first mastering ourselves.</p>

<strong>Zoe</strong><br><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>

                    <p>My name is Zoe Kantor and I was born in Boston Massachusetts. I became an accidental aerialist while living in Korea two years ago. I have a background in dance and was looking for a studio to train at, however everything was in Korean so I was having trouble. The one studio I found that had anything in English was a Pole Dance studio, so I went. I instantly fell in love. </p>
                    <p>I certainly faced challenges learning from people who spoke minimal English, but I knew that I had found my true art form. Upon moving to New York City I began training at Body and Pole, and soon after they hired me to be a work-study. Ever since I have fully committed my life to becoming the best aerialist I can be. Being a part of ONE would be an amazing opportunity for me to become part of the aerial community, and share my love of this newfound artistry.</p>

                    <p>In 2002, I was the United States Rhythmic Gymnastics Junior National Champion — but a year later, at age 15, an eating disorder forced me out of the sport and into treatment. After a spiritual awakening eight years ago and learning to live for a higher Christian purpose, I was able to overcome anorexia and return to the sport, becoming a member of the 2009 US Rhythmic Gymnastics World Championships Group Team. </p>
                    <p>I now have a degree in psychology, and I am a speaker for eating disorder awareness, body image, and self esteem. I have found performing to be a way I can inspire others to appreciate their uniqueness and see the inner beauty in everyone. I am excited to be part of ONE in New York, which celebrates the strength of one in harmony with others and the natural world around them. </p>

                    <p>I was born in Portland , Oregon and moved around much of my life starting as a trained ballet dancer and then ended up in a painful back injury which led me to go to school to become a Licensed Massage Therapist. In loving the work of helping others with their pain both physical and mental my heart needed something for me again, which meant performing, I needed to make art again.</p>
                    <p>My desire to return to dance was not strong enough and so I discovered aerial, dancing in the air. Aerial arts for me are everything that fits my life and who I am as a person and what I believe in for this life…”All in or all out.” I am thankful every day to be able to live this gift and share my heart with others in such a special way. It will mean the world to me to be a part of ONE in the city that lifted me up to who I am today after I came with literally nothing 11 years ago.

                    <p>I was born in Bloomfield, NJ. I was originally a dancer and I discovered aerial a few years after I had knee surgery. I found it easier on my knee and began to really enjoy being in the air. Eventually, I switched from making dance the major focus of my career to making aerial my main focus. </p>
                    <p>Although, I still take dance class occasionally and do random dance projects here and there, I am now a full time professional aerialist, teaching classes during the day and performing in the evening. I am interested in ONE for a few reasons but mainly because I enjoy two-point harness and don’t get the opportunity to do it so often. Also, I think it is really exciting to safely be 150 feet up in the air.

<strong>Angelica</strong><br><strong>Boston, Massachussets</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born in Boston, MA and grew up in Minneapolis, MN. My dream of flying started at a young age, I used to run up and down my front lawn with an umbrella hoping I would take off. I aspired to be an astronaut, planning to join the air force to fly fighter jets, as I was told that was the ticket to flying in space. But my creative streak and desire for world peace–and the fact that I was too short to join the airforce–all put a wrench in that plan. I found hang gliding, learned how to fly and teach on the same sand dunes that the Wright bothers took their first flight. But art was still missing from my flying. My journeys lead me to New York, where I discovered harness work, perfection, flying and art combined!!! </p>
                    <p>ONE is a mile stone project that will radically change the way people think about public art and the urban landscape. I am excited too see what the energy of so many people who love to fly will create! </p>

                    <p>I was born in New York. During college I began training as an aerialist after a lifetime of gymnastics and dance. It quickly became a passion, and I became an instructor in addition to performing all over the United States. One of my biggest challenges was performing in front of a national television audience on last year’s “America’s Got Talent.” Live audiences were no problem, but the idea of broader exposure was daunting. Ultimately I won the praise of the audience, the judges, and even the other competitors! It was a great feeling. </p>
                    <p>For me, ONE is an amazing opportunity to be involved with a large project that will capture the hearts and imaginations of so many people.

<strong>Myriam</strong><br><strong>Quebec City, Canada</strong>
</div>
                    <p>Born in Quebec City I have always been attracted by performing arts and the love of challenge. I started attending the Quebec City Circus School while very young.  There, I discovered a truly fascinating world, which became mine.  I quickly realized that my place was in the air: I was twelve when I created my first act, an aerial hoop duo. Always at ease high up in the air, I was hooked!  </p>
                    <p>I continued training for several years, focusing on aerials. Since my departure from the Quebec City Circus School in 2008, I have had the opportunity to work for numerous organizations and to appear in various events around the world. Recently, I created a new solo, a poetic and acrobatic aerial hoop act. Seeking challenges, aiming higher and better, I thrive on teamwork and collaborating closely in new projects. ONE in New York City represents for me a great opportunity for new aerial adventures.</p>

                    <p>As a child, I played many sports, but dance and gymnastics took turns being my main focus.  After graduating from a performing arts high school with a dance major, I went to school for welding, then for interior architecture, which helped me realize I was not made to be sitting all day.  </p>
                    <p>I dropped out of school, moved to France as a nanny to learn French, and on my return decided to take circus more seriously as I had dabbled in it since I was 18.  Being interested in so many things made it difficult to decide what I wanted to do for a career, so I had a little bit of a late start in the circus world.  I feel this project is a beautiful opportunity that will add to my strength as a performer and truly brings my personal past, present, and future together as “ONE.”</p>

                    <p>Growing up in a wealthy college town in Upstate New York, I didn’t know I was poor until age fifteen; when your jeans are more important than your talents and character. Somehow, my Mother, a single parent, provided me with training in the performing arts. I witnessed my Papa, a Mexican immigrant, struggle to survive, leaving behind his homeland and career. My parent’s sacrificed dreams have motived me in the pursuit of mine.</p>

Four years ago my close friend and mentor introduced me to some of the creators of AiRealisitc, and I couldn’t get enough of being in the air. For the remainder of the time, I spent all of my free time in class and was quickly asked to be apart of their new show, Breaking Surface. For the past four years I have been working with them and other companies on shows around the city. </p>
                    <p>Aerial dance was what I was missing in life and ONE has many different meanings to me. Not only will it be an amazing experience and educational for myself, but also for all of those who I care for.</p>

                    <p>In my professional career I have been very fortunate to find work. One of my challenges has been to continually find meaning. I have struggled with my own motivation – with the temptation to sometimes become jaded with shows that are only designed to make quick buck.</p>
                    <p>I’m excited to be part of ONE because it is stunningly brilliant spectacles that will make passersby literally stop in their tracks and marvel. More importantly I love what it expresses: oneness, unity, beauty, peace… dozens of beautiful bodies moving as a whole being. I’m proud to be part of ONE because I believe it brings a powerful message that will make a positive and lasting impact on millions of people.

<strong>Meghan</strong><br><strong>Santa Cruz, California</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born in the coastal California town of Santa Cruz.  At six, my body, mind, and character found their match in gymnastics.  It was a thrill I couldn’t quit, playing with the forces of the universe as they acted on my body, flying me high and then knocking me back down under the thumb of gravity.  I devoted the greater part of my days and years to the sport.</p>
                    <p>At the end of my competitive career, I was left with the feeling that I still held this finely tuned instrument that could at last be played with abandon.  I signed my whole soul to the circus, trusting it to make beautiful use my skill. As an aerialist, I am often inspired by an image (umbrellas swept up by the wind, a feather’s random fall-path) and I perform to share these inspirations with everyone.

<strong>Aisha</strong><br><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>
</div>
                    <p>As the daughter of a dancer, having grown up in the studio, dance has always been in my heart. I thought I knew what kind of dancer I wanted to be, until a friend urged me to come to aerial practice with her. I felt a world open up, but rehearsals with the Alvin Ailey Company seemed to dominate my time. In 2010 I tore my ACL. </p>
                    <p>During eight months of rehabilitation I started taking Lyra (hoop) class, though I was apprehensive about my physical limitations. I fell in love with flying all over again. I needed it to be a part of my life. When I saw the post for ONE I felt uplifted, hopeful and renewed. I want to be a part of this because it’s in my heart to dance and soar, and together we can be uplifted and all fly as one. </p>

<strong>Geneviève</strong><br><strong>St-Jerôme, Canada</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born in St-Jerôme, a town near Montreal city, that’s where I started practicing gymnastic and dance at a young age. When I got old enough, I moved to Montreal to study contemporary dance, graduated, and when to the National circus school of Montreal to continue my artistic formation as a circus artist as an acrobat. My first touch with aerialist performance was with the show “Traces” from Les 7 doigts de la main. I had two months to learn and put together an aerial strap solo act. Since then, I pushed my aerial performances into a duo strap with another woman. Being elegant and fluid in the air is so different from the floor. </p>
                    <p>My biggest challenge was to take part of the show “Traces” as one of five acrobats, being the only female artist on stage–had to learn to be a multidisciplinary circus artist in a few months, learned new disciplines, skills and acrobatic lifts. Touring the world with that show brought me so much experience on how to be myself on stage and to push away the fear. I really have this project, ONE, at hearth cause it combines the way I’m use to work with my body with a completely different way of staging that what I’m use to.

<strong>Jade</strong><br><strong>St-Jerôme, Canada</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I decided when I was young about what I wanted to do with my life. When I was three years old I decided to become a trapezist – and that is exactly what happened. I remember being inspired by a Cirque Du Soleil show at a very young age. At the age of 18, I decided to pack my bags and follow my dream of travelling and working in the industry. I’ve always been interested in new experiences and expressing my art in different contexts. Reaching out to people using my passion, as a vector has always been important for me – which are why I have participated in various social projects around the world.</p>
                    <p>Two years ago I suffered a severe back injury and spent 15 months in rehabilitation. Being away from my passion caused me to discover in myself a strong will to overcome adversity. Working with ONE would be my first time working as part of such a big project involving so many artists and accessible to so many people. Let’s take our art to the streets! It is our duty to share poetry and passion for beauty and make life extraordinary.

<strong>Sara</strong><br><strong>Berkshire County, Massachusetts</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born and raised in the farm hills of Berkshire County, Massachusetts. Always being the black sheep in my family, it was clear that my life would not follow the same path as most of my peers. From a young age I was extremely competitive in the tenacious sport of gymnastics.  </p>
                    <p>I always loved tumbling, soaring in the air and throwing myself around as I completed tricks.  After executing a tumbling pass, I would often ask my parents and coaches, “How high did I get in the air that time?”. At the sensitive age of 15 I sustained a serious neck injury and began to dance as a form of rehabilitation.  I just loved how free I could be with my body and how performing brought out an entirely new expressive part of my soul.

<strong>Marissa</strong><br><strong>New York, New York</strong>
</div>
                    <p>My growing up was very nomadic – constantly moving and never feeling tied down to one place. Maybe because of that, the expression of flight seemed to find me and made so much sense for my body. It does something magical and wondrous for the spirit. With family hardship, post-college confusion, aerial became the outlet that grounded me and uplifted my sense of self. In this culture, it becomes harder and harder to see outside our bubble, to see the bigger picture. </p>
                    <p>A project like ONE is reminding us of a larger vision that’s possible, that is necessary for this world. When I have the opportunity to fly for ONE, I will harness all of that creative vitality and energy and allow it to hammock all the aerialists as we take our moment of departure. Sometimes, to see the world in a refreshing way, you need to change your perspective.

<strong>Nicole</strong><br><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born Sept 11, 1987 in Miami Fl, inconveniently, the same day Pope John Paul II was visiting the city. Aside from a creative mad dash to the hospital weaving around millions in the streets, it was a blessed day for both my parents, and the city of Miami. Since that Sunday morning in 87′ my life has continued to jolt me into challenging situations, forced me to think creatively both out of intrigue and out of necessity, and lastly, has surrounded me with people and opportunities that I believe to be small blessings. Unfortunately, on that same day, 14 years later, terrorists on a grand scale that left the island of Manhattan in ruins, both physically and mentally, attacked New York City. </p>
                    <p>Though time did a remarkable job mending this city, there is still fear and heartbreak in hidden corners on this metropolis. And that is why I believe art is important- because it lifts people out of those natural traps. When I hear of projects like ONE, I become instantly inspired and marvel at how this human evolving sculpture will transport hundreds of onlookers daily, and in turn, inspire them.

                    <p>I was born in Denver, CO. and moved to Metarie, LA. when she was 3yrs old. My first tooth was lost on Bourbon Street, but I acquired a love for costumes, glitter, and sequins, a sign of things to come. Uprooted again at 11 to St Louis, MO where I attended the Visual and Performing Arts High School, my journey would prompt more moves over the next few years, including the University of Iowa for a B.A in dance, NYC for the certificate program at Alvin Ailey, San Francisco and Hungry Horse, MO., where I worked at a diner near Glacier National Park, and back to NYC where I have remained for 13 years. </p>
                    <p>I teach at Circus Warehouse and perform around town at various venues including Galapagos Art Space, Gowanus Ballroom, Slipper Room, and Dixon Place. Personally, I found aerial while soul-searching to find new ways to move and communicate with the world around me.</p>

<strong>Emily</strong><br><strong>Rochester, New York</strong>

                    <p>I was born in Rochester, NY in a birthing room just after midnight on the day of May 28th, 1983 with a full head of red hair.  By the age of 3 my mom had already put me in ballet class and I loved wearing pink, being graceful, and expressing myself through movement. I continued ballet and jazz and went to LaGuardia HS for music and the performing arts followed by Juilliard for a BFA. Before graduation I auditioned and was accepted to Cirque du Soleil’s newest creation in 2005 called “Love” which consisted of all Beatles music.   </p>
                    <p>Just after I started to perform the rope act, my father was killed in a cycling accident and for a while after I was terrified to do anything, especially the rope act. I didn’t let the fear overpower me though and instead saw each performance as another accomplishment that my dad would be so proud of. It would be an honor to perform in ONE and be able to fly again, knowing that my father will be right there flying with me.

<strong>Caterina</strong><br><strong>San Lucido, Italy</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I’m from South of Italy, from a very small place called San Lucido (CS) a piece of heaven: A place where buildings don’t exist, where there is space for the pink sky and between mountains and sea you dream to fly. A place that seems drawn by Caravaggio where, as my father says, God has posed. Strong sensations and emotions keep me alive. Who doesn’t dream to fly? Who doesn’t think how life can be in the sky? Almost unconsciously these thoughts came to life. </p>
                    <p>Draw into air the dove of peace for the Inaugural Ceremony of the XX Winter Olympic Games in Torino, Italy and to explode and surrender in the sky like a flower with the kitonb Extreme Theatre. Very challenging and at that time I swore it would be the last time. I got so high that I had to close my eyes. </p>

<strong>Jenny</strong><br><strong>Freeport, Texas</strong>
</div>
                    <p>So I was born in Freeport, Texas, raised in Skaneateles, NY till I was 16, and then moved to the west coast from there to finish school and college. While I was growing up, I always loved dancing.  It was always a way for me to express myself in ways that words could not touch upon, but also as I was growing up, I always had dreams of being able to float through the air and flying over landscapes and soaring over large masses of water. I never knew any of these things were even remotely possible, that is until I saw my very first circus performance, put on by Cirque du Soleil. </p>
                    <p>It was Quidam, in the very ending scene, I saw the girl soar through the silks, to me it literally looked like she was diving through the silks back and forth so effortlessly and with such grace. When I started learning aerial and training, I knew it would be hard, but I was ready for the tough work and from my background I knew it I stayed dedicated to what I love and to what felt right, that I would be doing no wrong.  </p>
                    <p>So I stuck to my dreams, faced a lot of fears and learning to trust, and learned so much about myself in the process, I always am. </p>

<strong>Rian</strong><br><strong>New York, New York</strong>
</div>
                    <p>When I am not studying applied economics, I’m training in various mediums of aerial arts.  Somewhere in between my obsession with dance and economic models I became passionate for this intriguing private sector of the arts. Throughout high school I danced in Georgio’s American Dance Company and performed with companies such as Orlando Ballet, Russian Academy of Ballet (Orlando, FL), and Momentum Live. Within her first two years of college I founded Seminole State Dance Company and performed with Yow Dance.  </p>
                    <p>I am currently obtaining my BA in Politics, Philosophy, and Economics while simultaneously broadening my training experience and resources here in NYC. Within the past three years my training emphasis has shifted to both training and teaching pole fitness. My vested interest in developing the best learning environment possible is in direct correlation to my ultimate goals of captivating audiences, communicating effectively, and developing movement awareness/intention.

<strong>Cody</strong><br><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was raised in Brooklyn, NY. My love of flying started when I was 8 years old on a trip to club med where they had a flying trapeze. But, it wasn’t until I was 20 and recovering from a 4-year battle with anorexia and depression that I got to pursue my childhood dream. Being back in the air reconnected me with loving my body and wanting to feel healthy and strong, enabling me to finally make a full recovery and live life with passion and joy.  Eventually, aerials became not only my passion, but also my career.  </p>
                    <p>I think ONE has the ability to bring a large community of people together in a positive, awe-inspiring way and is honored to be a part of that. Coming together with other performers and working hard for a common goal is an amazing expression of “Oneness”, something I believe in spiritually and continually strive to understand on a deeper level. </p>

                    <p>Born and raised in Oceanside, I’m no stranger to the New York art scene and hold a degree in Dance and Urban Design from NYU Tisch School of the Arts. Always aware of my calling in life (to understand and implement movement), I became a personal trainer after graduation. My dreams were put on hold for nearly three years due to a devastating injury: a dislocated ankle after trying to do a back flip. </p>
                    <p>Now physically and mentally stronger than ever, I am determined to see my dreams of becoming an aerialist come to fruition. ONE embodies every element that I am drawn to: unison, independence, movement, breath, power, teamwork, strength, and grace. I am excited to be a part of this project, one that I believe is a true reflection of all that is a good, hopeful and promising in our world.</p>

<strong>Danielle</strong><br><strong>Jersey City, New Jersey</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born to two artists in the suburbs of New Jersey, and began my dance training at the age of three. As years passed, I tried hard to keep up with the demands of formal dance training growing up, but due to certain limitations, I soon gave up on my dreams of dancing professionally. Seven years ago I found pole dancing as a means to an end. But, upon unleashing all the pent up energy from years of feeling inadequate, not graceful, or too big on stage, I found my work in the air transforming my life on the ground. I had found new purpose through the aerial arts. </p>
                    <p>With no job after graduating the School of Visual Arts and a looming recession, I decided to sink every last bit of energy into my work on the pole.<br>
                    Today, I can eat and sleep comfortably from these efforts: this art form has saved my life. Although people still struggle to understand what it is I do, I find it a welcoming challenge to help shape people’s perception of the aerial arts in a positive, groundbreaking, and inspirational matter. By becoming a part of ONE, I will finally be proud of that little girl inside who never stopped trying; who danced to the beat of her own heart; and who has finally found a family that will teach her to fly. </p>

<strong>Emily</strong><br><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>

                    <p>I grew up competing in Irish dance in Southern California, addicted to its rhythm and spirit. I craved taking my dance into, literally, higher, and more expressive realms. I moved to Portland, OR in January 2012, supporting myself as an independent Pilates instructor, building my student base while working and training at Ecdysiast, an aerial pole studio. I strive to bring the same rhythm, spirit, and dedication to my aerial dance that I did to my step dancing.</p>
                    <p>After a coworker showed me the video and audition notice for ONE, I knew it was a project I needed to be a part of. I was thrilled when I made the auditions and got to make my first trip to NYC. The sheer energy of NY is unbelievable and I’m excited to bring my own energy ONE in New York!</p>

<strong>Xochitl</strong><br><strong>Berkeley, California</strong>
</div>
                    <p>Born to a Mexican father and an American mother I grew up in Berkeley, CA. I began my relationship with aerials at age eight, first experiencing it at a circus arts camp in CA. There were few affordable aerial classes in the Bay area and because of this I was fairly self-taught until my early twenties. At age 21 while attending University of Texas and teaching full time at an aerials studio I realized I wanted to make aerial arts a full time profession. This decision led me to attend New England Center for Circus Art’s Professional Track program. </p>
                    <p>Aerial dance is truly where I am happiest and where my mind and body have found a refreshing co-existence. For me ONE is this similar idea of co-existence, it is that feeling of kinetic energy of human existence projected in the air. </p>

<strong>Hilary</strong><br><strong>Boston, Massachussets</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born with a birth defect…at 4lbs, premature, my legs and feet were completely turned in. The doctors had to break my legs to reset them so I could walk. Of course, at 5 years old I wanted to be a ballet dancer, completely ignoring the fact that I would not physically be capable of the perfect turnout that is required to succeed.  Even still, I devoted my life to the study of ballet, but I with never quite fit the mold. When I discovered aerial, I found my calling. It was the first time in my life that I didn’t have to fit the mold…I could make my own mold. And so I did. I have made a career out of fusing my ballet training and love for classical music, with aerial. </p>
                    <p>However, I miss the communal and collaborative experience that being part of a dance company brings, as aerial is comparatively a solitary activity.  That is why ONE excites me so much…it offers the rare, if not only, opportunity to unite otherwise solo aerialists into a single body of living art. </p>

                    <p>I was born and raised in south Texas. After performing in musicals and shows most of my life, a trip to Vegas allowed me to see Cirque du Soleil live for the first time and I was mesmerized and wanted to fly too. A few months’ later classes started where I was living. One class had me hooked and 3 months of hard work later I submitted and was accepted to one of NECCA’s (New England Center for Circus Arts) professional programs. </p>
                    <p>I quit my job, packed up my car, and drove to Vermont where I soaked up all the aerial skills I could, especially in fabric and lyra (hoop) which were my major and minor. After NECCA I moved to NYC, where I now live, teach, and fly. Being a part of ONE for me is like being part of a beautiful orchestra of the skies.

<strong>Christi</strong><br><strong>San Antonio, Texas</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born in Boston, Massachusetts. I was drawn to the aerial arts after I had been dancing professionally for over a decade. I fell in love with it. I immersed myself in every class I could find, on almost every apparatus I had heard of or could see. Sometimes I miss those years because since working professionally as an aerialist, I have found, like so many things, the challenges of working can sometimes overshadow the initial passion that brought me to the art form. </p>
                    <p>Alas, when I look back at the various jobs I’ve been lucky to have as an aerialist, it is all still so worth it. There is nothing like performing in the air. It is it’s own magical, indescribable joyous experience. To be a part of ONE would be something to connect me, not just to my other fellow aerialists, but to a city and community of people I treasure. </p>

<strong>Vincent</strong><br><strong>Québec City, Canada</strong>
</div>
                    <p>Born in Quebec city, I started as a dancer student at École de danse de Québec,while training in circus at École de Cirque de Québec. After few years of performance as a dancer and a circus artist, I meet Ghislain Turcotte who brought me to harness work. I was then able to combine both passions into one great universe: aerial dance. From Cirque du Soleil to Robert Lepage I got the chance to prove myself as a good artist, coordinator and coach in the aerial harness art. Then came this audition in Montreal. ONE was looking for harness artists. </p>
                    <p>What a great experience it was to finally get in touch with people who share that same passion. Being part of ONE would be a life changing experience, giving me the chance to fly with so many others and be part of that “once in a life time” event.</p>

<strong>Marina</strong><br><strong>St. Petersburg, Russia</strong>
</div>
                    <p>Born and raised in St. Petersburg, Russia, I started dancing at the age of 6. After 9 years of ballet and ballroom dance training I quit in order to enter a prestigious school and pursue a career in Business. I rediscovered my passion for dance a little over 2 years ago when I tried a pole dancing class and immediately fell in love with aerial arts. Started with pole dancing I soon enriched my training with flexibility, aerial fabrics, acrobatics and hand balancing, and was blown away with what my (or anyone’s) body is capable of. I strive to become a professional dancer and cherish every opportunity to perform: I recently won my first pole competition and getting ready for the next. </p>
                    <p>ONE for me is a symbol of harmony and connections we have to one another; as well as an ode to beauty, passion, inspiration, diversity, creativity and talent.</p>

<strong>Natalie</strong><br><strong>Humboldt, California</strong>
</div>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Humboldt County, California, where I took ballet since I was very young. Leaping was always my favorite thing–I’ve always aimed for the air! My first taste of the sky was parasailing with my Dad—the ONE audition reminded me a lot of that seamless transition from the ground to the air. My challenge in the “dance world” so far has been not feeling like I fit in, not being truly excited by what I’ve seen. </p>
                    <p>On a selfish level, that is why I am so excited about ONE in New York—I had a tingly feeling come over me at the audition. On a bigger level, it holds meaning for me as art for the people. I imagine all types of people coming to the park, looking toward the sky together, and feeling a sense of wonder at the power of human unity.</p>

                    <p>Originally from Houston, Texas, I knew at a young age I was meant to dance. I studied ballet intensively from age 6 on, training with prominent ballet companies around the world. I attended The University of Texas at Austin, where I began training in contemporary dance, and upon receiving my B.F.A. in Dance in 2010, I moved to NYC to pursue a professional career.</p>
                    <p>Somehow, amid performing with contemporary companies around the city and acquiring my M.A. in Dance Education from NYU, I fell in love with aerial dance. From pole to lyra, I found my passion for flying and haven’t stopped! Since then I have become a part of a mixed aerial dance company, AERA, and enjoy teaching ballet, flexibility, and aerial classes at Body &amp; Pole in NYC. </p>
                    <p>I look forward to being a part of ONE and sharing with the world what aerial dance can be! </p>

                    <p>Raised in a small town in upstate New York, I grew up literally dancing in my sister’s footsteps. I spent over a decade performing classical ballet before I even graduated high school. At 17 I struggled with a minor back injury, stopped dancing, and began University. After two years lost in college, the hole that dance had left in my heart had not yet been filled. An unexpected and serendipitous chain of events introduced me to the world of contemporary circus. I met performers that could dance in the air. So I did what any responsible young adult would, I dropped out of college and moved to a different state to pursue my new dream. </p>
                    <p>As they say, the rest is history. To me aerial work is a perfect combination of unique physical challenges, the thrill of stage performance, the beauty of dance, and the magic of circus. This is what makes ONE such an exciting project to be involved with</p>

<strong>Allison</strong><br><strong>Orange County, California</strong>
</div>
                    <p>Born in Southern California, I trained as a dancer and gymnast since the age of 3.  I attended OCHSA and received a BFA from The Juilliard School.  After, I joined Cirque Du Soleil where I was introduced to aerial work.  I trained harness, hoops, silks and pole.  Since, deciding to leave Cirque, I have continued training in aerial but have not had the opportunity to perform it.  I am so happy to be a part of ONE because this is my opportunity to get back in the air and perform for an audience!  The one major challenge I’ve faced this far is my severe scoliosis.  </p>
                    <p>I was diagnosed with this in middle school and had to wear a brace.  Through dance, I was able to teach myself how to correct my alignment. It is still a challenge in my everyday life and career path, but I am happy to have gained the knowledge needed to help the problem.  In my opinion, ONE is a very important project to be presented to the public because of the collaboration and the venue chosen to produce it.  ONE will open the eyes of many onlookers that know nothing about what we do. Being a part of something so brilliant and creatively advanced is an honor for me.</p>

<strong>Sarah</strong><br><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>
</div>
                    <p>Ballet was my escape and my obsession growing up, and I began dancing in earnest at the age of 5. In college, I continued to dance but began to focus my attention on visual art as well as costume design. It was when I moved to Vermont that I saw my first circus show and totally fell in love with aerials. Here was the perfect interweaving of my seemingly disjointed passions! </p>
                    <p>The strength required to achieve what I choreographed in my mind enticed me, and becoming a strong person in my physical body has translated into an internal transformation for me as well, including finally overcoming an eating disorder that I had for many years. When I am in the air, I lose myself in the movement, lost in my art, and I can’t think of anything I would rather devote my heart to than that feeling. </p>

<strong>Destiny</strong><br><strong>Boston, Massachussets</strong>
</div>
                    <p>My first airborne performance was as a rambunctious kid in 1988 who, after watching the winter Olympics, was convinced she could complete a perfect triple sal-chow in snow boots on ice-covered tennis courts. After recovering from that concussion, I focused my energy on the less concussive pursuits of theater and art. In my senior year of undergrad in Interdisciplinary Art, I fused visual and performing arts by placing my body in suspended sculptural environments. This led me to research and try aerial silks– it changed my life’s direction. </p>
                    <p>I have since co-founded two aerial companies, trained full time at the National Institute of Circus Arts (Australia), started a recreational aerial program, completed the professional program at the New England Center for Circus Arts (Vermont), joined the core staff at NECCA, and began traveling the world to teach and perform aerials.

                    <p>I was born in a small town in the Midwest where, Ringling Bros. set up a permanent circus in the 1800′s and put Baraboo, Wisconsin on the map. I was not “born into” performing in the circus, rather one lucky day when I was about 13, I was asked to learn the Spanish Web and join my hometown one ring show. Since then, I have performed in Madison Square Garden, an Italian monastery, music videos, 9 stories off Opera buildings, tree branches and formal theatres. Currently, I teach aerial yoga, aerial dance, silks and other movement modalities, as well as, choreographing my own work.</p>
                    <p>Dancing and aerial arts has taught me resilience and to have the courage to follow my dreams despite challenges I have faced along the way, ranging from near death experiences, to the true test in life of a broken heart. Thru the art of aerial dance, we can find inspiration and healing, which can be life changing for people. “ONE” will be a long ripple, of a larger force of unique individuals coming together as a whole, that can change lives through beauty and divine nature.</p>

As a kid in Lima I was always climbing my grandma’s orange trees, I was the best climber in the neighborhood.  Maybe that’s also why performing in the air feels so natural to me.  I’m literally uplifted and I want to share that emotion with other people.</p>
                    <p>That emotion helps me to face my personal challenge, which is that I’m shy, which is also why I started dancing. Dancing allows me to be part of something so much bigger than myself and it takes me outside myself.  To me ONE represents the artistic energy; unity, beauty and diversity of the city that I left my home for, the city that made me re-imagine what the world could be all about.</p>

<strong>Anthony</strong><br><strong>Aix-en-provence, France</strong>
</div>
                    <p>Hello my name is Anthony. I was born during the summer 1988 in Aix-en-provence, France. I first started dance and performing on stage when I was 4 years old. One day, I saw the circus on TV. One thing was sticking in my mind: the flying trapeze.</p>
                    <p>7 years old, here I am in a circus school doing my first steps in the air. Only 3 years after, I knew that I wanted to be a trapeze artist, knew that I wanted to fly and share my experience with an audience. From there, did a pre-professional circus school in France, then the National Circus School of Montreal. 4 years later, I started performing around the world and going through challenges like performing at the Festival Mondial du Cirque de Demain in Paris.</p>
                    <p>For me, ONE means a whole new level of aerial performance and a form of expression completely unique and original, letting the artists and the audience gets taken in a surreal aerial journey.

<strong>Sadie</strong><br><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>
</div>
                        <p>I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon where I attended a performing arts high school.  The director of the dance program Steve Gonzales was incredibly influential in shaping my performance career.  He introduced me to contemporary dance, aerial arts, and New York City.  With his guidance and the support of my parents, I moved to New York to get my Bachelors of Fine Arts at Fordham University and The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.  I was immersed in the arts and eventually drawn to training and performing solely as an aerialist. </p>
                        <p>My journey as a performer has since given me the opportunity to travel internationally and perform on some of the world’s biggest stages.  It has also allowed me to fulfill a desire of mine; getting to share my passion and artistry with audiences worldwide.</p>

<strong>Susie</strong><br><strong>Cincinnati, Ohio</strong>
</div>
                        <p>I grew up in Cincinnati and went to college at Northwestern University. I majored in theater, not so much because I wanted to be an actor, but because I loved the rehearsal process. At the time, I really wasn’t driven to perform; I just knew I needed my life to include creating live art in some way. Shortly after college, I was introduced to aerial when I worked on a play in London that used a static trapeze as a set piece. </p>
                        <p>Years later, through a lot of training and discipline: I am proud to have a career as an aerial performer, instructor and choreographer. I’m so thrilled to be involved in ONE. To have this opportunity to do what I love, with so many people, on such a massive scale, is really incredible. </p>

<p>
  I began my dance training at the age of 6, with ballet, contemporary, &amp; jazz. In 2010 I studied dance for one year in NYC and performed for Tracie Stanfield and Brice Mousset. I started Aerial Silks, which I instantly fell in love with. In Switzerland I worked for the company Deep Emotions, the Opera the Flying Dutch and made it to the Swiss Got Talent Finals. In 2012 I granted my artist visa for the USA and performed as a dancer or aerialist at Capitale, Secret Theater NYC, Gowanus Ballroom, Aerial Arts NYC and Dixon Place. I was also part of the Yamulee Salsa Dance Company and taught aerial at the Muse in Brooklyn. </p>

<p>Currently, I am a dancer and aerialist for Royal Caribbean International Productions. It has always been my dream to perform in an outdoors location in NYC and I am excited to work with so many talented people.

<p>
My journey started the moment I went to see the circus for the first time age 3. I instantly wanted to join the circus and knew I was going to be a performer. </p>


  <p>I started ballet classes and still remember my first stage performance age 5. I climbed my first rope age 5 at a circus day at the Barbican Centre and have spent a great deal of my life in the air ever since. Training at the Circus Space, London, from a young age I specialised in Aerial disciplines including solo and doubles static trapeze and flying trapeze, as well as dance, acrobatics and theatre. </p>


<p>I joined the London Youth Circus and began taking extra classes in Aerial Rope, Spanish Web and Silks, before specialising in Rope for my BA Honours Degree in Circus Arts. My passion for performance blossomed, freeing my body and mind to be able to create, improvise and devise on the floor and in the air. I have always enjoyed performing, using my body to express myself, and love the feeling of dancing in the air. 
  I have spent many years developing my skills, working with different companies and challenging myself. Working with ONE is something I am really looking forward to, and think it will be an amazing experience to be a part of, bringing together many bodies to create one beauty in the sky. </p>
